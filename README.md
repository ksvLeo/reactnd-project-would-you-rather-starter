Welcome to Would You Rather! A project born from the eager intention to get some hands on experience on React & Redux. The project idea and rubric are part of the React NanoDegree course, given by Udacity. This React App was built with just the vanilla tools of create-react-app and a few more libraries, in order to run it, you'll just need to run npm/yarn install and then npm/yarn start. As that's the case, I'll leave the default documentation of create-react-app for further detail.

# Getting Started with Create React App
